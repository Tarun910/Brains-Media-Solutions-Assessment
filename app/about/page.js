                  Harry’s coding journey began in high school when he stumbled
                  upon his first programming language—Python. What started as a
                  simple curiosity quickly turned into a passion, as Harry spent
                  countless hours experimenting with code, building small
                  projects, and learning the fundamentals of software
                  development.
